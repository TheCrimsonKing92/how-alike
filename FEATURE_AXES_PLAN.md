## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Landmark-Based Core (Week 1)
**Focus**: Implement reliable geometric measurements that don't require segmentation

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/feature-axes.ts` - Measurement extraction functions
- `web/src/lib/axis-classifiers.ts` - Category classification with thresholds
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-axes.test.ts` - Unit tests for measurements

**Features to Implement**:
- Eyes: canthal tilt, eye size, interocular distance
- Nose: width, bridge contour, tip projection
- Mouth: lip fullness, Cupid's bow, corner orientation, philtrum length, mouth width
- Jaw: width, mandibular angle, chin projection, chin width, symmetry

**Deliverable**: Functions that take landmarks and return axis values

```typescript
// Example API
interface FeatureMeasurements {
  eyes: {
    canthalTilt: number; // degrees
    eyeSize: number; // mm or normalized units
    interocularDistance: number; // ratio
  };
  // ... other features
}

function extractFeatureMeasurements(
  landmarks: Point[],
  leftEye: Point,
  rightEye: Point
): FeatureMeasurements;
```

### Phase 2: Classification & Thresholds (Week 1-2)
**Focus**: Map measurements to categorical descriptors

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/axis-classifiers.ts` - Threshold-based classification
- `web/src/__tests__/axis-classifiers.test.ts` - Classification tests

**Thresholds Strategy**:
- Use anthropometric literature for base values
- Test on diverse face samples
- Adjust thresholds to match human perception

**Deliverable**: Classifier functions with validated thresholds

```typescript
interface AxisClassification {
  axis: string;
  value: string; // category name
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  rawMeasurement: number;
}

function classifyFeatures(
  measurements: FeatureMeasurements
): Record<string, AxisClassification[]>;
```

### Phase 3: Comparison & Narrative (Week 2)
**Focus**: Compare two faces and generate descriptive text

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/feature-comparisons.ts` - Comparison logic
- `web/src/lib/feature-narratives.ts` - Text generation
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-comparisons.test.ts`
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-narratives.test.ts`

**Deliverable**: Narrative output for all axes

```typescript
interface FeatureComparison {
  feature: string; // "eyes"
  axes: AxisComparison[];
  summary: string;
}

interface AxisComparison {
  axis: string;
  valueA: string;
  valueB: string;
  agreement: boolean;
  text: string;
}

function compareFeatures(
  featuresA: FeatureMeasurements,
  featuresB: FeatureMeasurements
): FeatureComparison[];
```

### Phase 4: Segmentation Enhancement (Week 3)
**Focus**: Add segmentation-dependent measurements

**Features to Add**:
- Eyebrows: thickness, density (requires masks)
- Nose: nostril visibility (requires masks)
- Eyes: scleral show (requires iris detection or masks)
- Cheeks: malar fat volume (requires masks)

**Graceful Degradation**: If segmentation unavailable, omit these axes or use landmark approximations

### Phase 5: Worker Integration (Week 3)
**Focus**: Integrate into existing worker pipeline

**Files to Modify**:
- `web/src/workers/analyze.worker.ts` - Add feature extraction
- `web/src/workers/types.ts` - Add result types

**Flow**:
```typescript
// In worker, after landmark detection
const measurementsA = extractFeatureMeasurements(ptsA, leftA, rightA);
const measurementsB = extractFeatureMeasurements(ptsB, leftB, rightB);

const classificationsA = classifyFeatures(measurementsA);
const classificationsB = classifyFeatures(measurementsB);

const comparisons = compareFeatures(measurementsA, measurementsB);
const narratives = generateFeatureNarratives(comparisons);

post({
  type: 'RESULT',
  // ... existing fields
  featureComparisons: comparisons,
  featureNarratives: narratives,
});
```

### Phase 6: UI Implementation (Week 4)
**Focus**: Display detailed feature analysis in collapsible panels

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/components/FeatureDetailPanel.tsx` - Expandable feature sections
- `web/src/components/AxisComparison.tsx` - Individual axis display

**UI Structure**:
```
Results Panel
├── Overall Similarity: 78%
├── Regional Scores (existing)
│   ├── eyes: 85% — nearly identical eye shape
│   └── nose: 70% — similar nose structure
└── Detailed Analysis (NEW)
    ├── 👁️ Eyes [expandable]
    │   ├── Canthal tilt: positive ↔ neutral
    │   ├── Eye size: average ↔ average ✓
    │   └── Interocular distance: balanced ↔ balanced ✓
    ├── 🔺 Eyebrows [expandable]
    │   └── ...
    └── 👃 Nose [expandable]
```

## Testing Strategy

- Confidence scoring for each axis
- Custom axis weighting for similarity
- Export detailed analysis as PDF/JSON

## Upcoming Enhancement: Jaw Labeling Reliability
**Goal**: Replace noisy landmark-only jaw metrics with a segmentation-informed synthetic jaw curve that remains WebGL-friendly and works without new model training.

### A. Synthetic Jaw From Existing Masks
- Normalize faces in the same coordinate space used by FaceMesh before processing logits.
- Derive a lower-face band from mandible landmarks plus a narrow strip below them to bound marching-squares search.
- From SegFormer logits expose `p(face_skin)` and `p(non_face) = p(hair ∪ background ∪ neck)` and locate the zero crossing of `p_face_skin − p_non_face` between jaw-angle landmarks to obtain a crisp polyline.
- Post-process the polyline with Chaikin or Savitzky–Golay smoothing, enforce monotonicity along the arc, and snap endpoints toward the near-ear landmark cluster.
- Export a thin polygon plus derived measurements (mandibular width, mandibular angle, chin projection) as the synthetic jaw descriptor.

### B. Landmark Prior + Confidence Blending
- Treat the existing landmark jaw curve as the base spline.
- Measure offsets from the landmark curve to the iso-contour inside a narrow normal band and compute blend weights via `α = clamp((p_skin − p_neck)/τ, 0..1)`.
- Blend curves per vertex and return both the fused polyline and an overall confidence score for downstream fallbacks.

### C. Logit Cleanup & Error Guards
- Inside the face ROI lower neck logits dramatically (e.g., subtract 1e6) to prevent neck bleed into cheeks/chin.
- Drop neck-connected components that appear above the jaw search band.

### Wiring Targets
- `web/src/lib/transformers-parsing-adapter.ts`: expose raw logits for face/skin/neck classes rather than only binary masks.
- `web/src/workers/analyze.worker.ts`: add `computeJawFromMasks()` to build the band, extract the iso-contour, blend with landmarks, and emit `{ polyline, confidence }`.
- `web/src/lib/feature-axes.ts`: consume the synthetic jaw metrics for width/angle/face-height calculations; fall back to landmarks when confidence < τ.
- `web/src/lib/overlay-hit-test.ts`: register the synthetic jaw polygon so overlays and tooltips remain interactive.

### Validation Checklist
- Hand-label ~50 reference jaw polylines (6–8 points each) for evaluation.
- Track mean surface distance between landmark-only and synthetic curves (lower is better).
- Measure stability under slight scale/flip/brightness perturbations (report standard deviation in pixels).
- Compare downstream metric variance (mandibular width/angle) and disagreement with human-provided tags to confirm improvements.

## Upcoming Enhancement: Eye Stability & Sub-Region Metrics
**Goal**: Reduce jitter in eye-related similarity scores and expose richer narratives that distinguish eyelids, iris/sclera, and orbital structure.

### A. Landmark Utilization & Filtering
- Extend canthal tilt inputs from 3-point averages to full upper/lower ring fits; evaluate PCA-based line through 8–10 outer-canthus neighbors to dampen single-point drift.
- Add iris center landmarks (468-series indices) to track eyeball pose; compare against eyelid arcs for explicit scleral-show measurements.
- Apply bilateral temporal smoothing by averaging aligned left/right measurements before classification, ensuring symmetry stays consistent.

### B. Eyelid & Crease Metrics
- Extract upper-lid curvature (fit quadratic/arc across 5–7 lid points) and classify as straight/curved/hooded.
- Compute upper-lid coverage ratio (distance from brow to lid vs eye height) to separate monolid vs defined-crease axes labeled in the spec but not yet implemented.
- Introduce lower-lid droop metric using inner-ring points to capture eye fatigue vs uplifted corners.

### C. Orbit & Eyeball Segmentation
- Reuse SegFormer classes (eyes vs skin vs eyebrows) to derive a tight mask for the eyeball itself; measure eyeball area, scleral-show percentage, and horizontal span relative to brow anchors.
- Prototype an “orbital depth” metric by comparing brow ridge/cheekbone z-depth to eye center, using FaceMesh z-values normalized by IPD.

### D. Overlay & Narrative Upgrades
- Split the current “eyes” outline into separate overlays: eyelid contour, iris/eyeball fill, and optional orbital guide lines for debugging.
- Update `feature-narratives.ts` to surface the new axes (crease definition, scleral show, orbital depth) with glossary links.

### E. Validation & Rollout
- Extend `measurement-variance.test.ts` to cover the new eye axes, logging observed jitter so we can derive per-axis tolerances instead of reuse the generic 0.24/0.09 defaults.
- Compare identical-image runs with/without the new metrics to ensure variance stays <⅓ of the calibrated thresholds before exposing the axes in UI.
