# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains historical planning documents that were used earlier in development but are no longer authoritative.

## Contents

### FEATURE_AXES_PLAN.md
Status: Completed

Detailed plan for implementing 8-axis morphological feature analysis. Outcomes now live in:
- Implementation: `web/src/lib/feature-axes.ts`, `axis-classifiers.ts`, `feature-comparisons.ts`, `feature-narratives.ts`
- Work log: `TASKS.md`

### IMPLEMENTATION.md
Status: Mostly completed

Original stage-by-stage implementation plan (Stage 0-6). The project currently sits at Stage 2+ (workerized, PWA shell, transformers.js parsing). Code style guidance was ported to `CLAUDE.md`.

## Notes
- Age calibration documents were retired alongside removal of the age validation pipeline (October 2025).
- These archived files remain for historical context only and should not be treated as active plans.
