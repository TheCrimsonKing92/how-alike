Sample images for local E2E tests

Place permissively licensed face photos here to drive end‑to‑end analysis tests.

Suggested filenames (used by tests if present):
- john-kovacich-brothers-right.jpg
- john-kovacich-brothers-left.jpg

Notes
- Images are not committed by default. Add them locally to run the sample test.
- Keep sizes modest (e.g., <= 2–4 MB) to reduce test latency.
