# Machine Learning Scripts

The calibration and training scripts in this directory assume **Python 3.10.x**.
They've been validated with **Python 3.10.0** alongside PyTorch and ONNX tooling.

Recommended setup:
- Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment (`pyenv`, `conda`, or `python -m venv`).
- Install script dependencies as needed (`pip install -r facexformer/requirements.txt` or per-script requirements).

Running outside Python 3.10 has not been exercised and may lead to dependency resolution issues or export incompatibilities.
