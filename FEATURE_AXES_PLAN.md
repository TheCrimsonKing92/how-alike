## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Landmark-Based Core (Week 1)
**Focus**: Implement reliable geometric measurements that don't require segmentation

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/feature-axes.ts` - Measurement extraction functions
- `web/src/lib/axis-classifiers.ts` - Category classification with thresholds
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-axes.test.ts` - Unit tests for measurements

**Features to Implement**:
- Eyes: canthal tilt, eye size, interocular distance
- Nose: width, bridge contour, tip projection
- Mouth: lip fullness, Cupid's bow, corner orientation, philtrum length, mouth width
- Jaw: width, mandibular angle, chin projection, chin width, symmetry

**Deliverable**: Functions that take landmarks and return axis values

```typescript
// Example API
interface FeatureMeasurements {
  eyes: {
    canthalTilt: number; // degrees
    eyeSize: number; // mm or normalized units
    interocularDistance: number; // ratio
  };
  // ... other features
}

function extractFeatureMeasurements(
  landmarks: Point[],
  leftEye: Point,
  rightEye: Point
): FeatureMeasurements;
```

### Phase 2: Classification & Thresholds (Week 1-2)
**Focus**: Map measurements to categorical descriptors

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/axis-classifiers.ts` - Threshold-based classification
- `web/src/__tests__/axis-classifiers.test.ts` - Classification tests

**Thresholds Strategy**:
- Use anthropometric literature for base values
- Test on diverse face samples
- Adjust thresholds to match human perception

**Deliverable**: Classifier functions with validated thresholds

```typescript
interface AxisClassification {
  axis: string;
  value: string; // category name
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  rawMeasurement: number;
}

function classifyFeatures(
  measurements: FeatureMeasurements
): Record<string, AxisClassification[]>;
```

### Phase 3: Comparison & Narrative (Week 2)
**Focus**: Compare two faces and generate descriptive text

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/lib/feature-comparisons.ts` - Comparison logic
- `web/src/lib/feature-narratives.ts` - Text generation
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-comparisons.test.ts`
- `web/src/__tests__/feature-narratives.test.ts`

**Deliverable**: Narrative output for all axes

```typescript
interface FeatureComparison {
  feature: string; // "eyes"
  axes: AxisComparison[];
  summary: string;
}

interface AxisComparison {
  axis: string;
  valueA: string;
  valueB: string;
  agreement: boolean;
  text: string;
}

function compareFeatures(
  featuresA: FeatureMeasurements,
  featuresB: FeatureMeasurements
): FeatureComparison[];
```

### Phase 4: Segmentation Enhancement (Week 3)
**Focus**: Add segmentation-dependent measurements

**Features to Add**:
- Eyebrows: thickness, density (requires masks)
- Nose: nostril visibility (requires masks)
- Eyes: scleral show (requires iris detection or masks)
- Cheeks: malar fat volume (requires masks)

**Graceful Degradation**: If segmentation unavailable, omit these axes or use landmark approximations

### Phase 5: Worker Integration (Week 3)
**Focus**: Integrate into existing worker pipeline

**Files to Modify**:
- `web/src/workers/analyze.worker.ts` - Add feature extraction
- `web/src/workers/types.ts` - Add result types

**Flow**:
```typescript
// In worker, after landmark detection
const measurementsA = extractFeatureMeasurements(ptsA, leftA, rightA);
const measurementsB = extractFeatureMeasurements(ptsB, leftB, rightB);

const classificationsA = classifyFeatures(measurementsA);
const classificationsB = classifyFeatures(measurementsB);

const comparisons = compareFeatures(measurementsA, measurementsB);
const narratives = generateFeatureNarratives(comparisons);

post({
  type: 'RESULT',
  // ... existing fields
  featureComparisons: comparisons,
  featureNarratives: narratives,
});
```

### Phase 6: UI Implementation (Week 4)
**Focus**: Display detailed feature analysis in collapsible panels

**Files to Create**:
- `web/src/components/FeatureDetailPanel.tsx` - Expandable feature sections
- `web/src/components/AxisComparison.tsx` - Individual axis display

**UI Structure**:
```
Results Panel

## Upcoming Enhancement: Jaw Labeling Reliability
**Goal**: Replace noisy landmark-only jaw metrics with a segmentation-informed synthetic jaw curve that remains WebGL-friendly and works without new model training.

### A. Synthetic Jaw From Existing Masks
- Normalize faces in the same coordinate space used by FaceMesh before processing logits.
- Derive a lower-face band from mandible landmarks plus a narrow strip below them to bound marching-squares search.
- From SegFormer logits expose `p(face_skin)` and `p(non_face) = p(hair ‚à™ background ‚à™ neck)` and locate the zero crossing of `p_face_skin ‚àí p_non_face` between jaw-angle landmarks to obtain a crisp polyline.
- Post-process the polyline with Chaikin or Savitzky‚ÄìGolay smoothing, enforce monotonicity along the arc, and snap endpoints toward the near-ear landmark cluster.
- Export a thin polygon plus derived measurements (mandibular width, mandibular angle, chin projection) as the synthetic jaw descriptor.

### B. Landmark Prior + Confidence Blending
- Treat the existing landmark jaw curve as the base spline.
- Measure offsets from the landmark curve to the iso-contour inside a narrow normal band and compute blend weights via `Œ± = clamp((p_skin ‚àí p_neck)/œÑ, 0..1)`.
- Blend curves per vertex and return both the fused polyline and an overall confidence score for downstream fallbacks.

### C. Logit Cleanup & Error Guards
- Inside the face ROI lower neck logits dramatically (e.g., subtract 1e6) to prevent neck bleed into cheeks/chin.
- Drop neck-connected components that appear above the jaw search band.

### Wiring Targets
- `web/src/lib/transformers-parsing-adapter.ts`: expose raw logits for face/skin/neck classes rather than only binary masks.
- `web/src/workers/analyze.worker.ts`: add `computeJawFromMasks()` to build the band, extract the iso-contour, blend with landmarks, and emit `{ polyline, confidence }`.
- `web/src/lib/feature-axes.ts`: consume the synthetic jaw metrics for width/angle/face-height calculations; fall back to landmarks when confidence < œÑ.
- `web/src/lib/overlay-hit-test.ts`: register the synthetic jaw polygon so overlays and tooltips remain interactive.

### Validation Checklist
- Hand-label ~50 reference jaw polylines (6‚Äì8 points each) for evaluation.
- Track mean surface distance between landmark-only and synthetic curves (lower is better).
- Measure stability under slight scale/flip/brightness perturbations (report standard deviation in pixels).
- Compare downstream metric variance (mandibular width/angle) and disagreement with human-provided tags to confirm improvements.
