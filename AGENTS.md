# Rules for Agents

## Implementation
- Prefer modern techniques and standards

## Quality
- All code must be tested, and all tests must pass, to be considered acceptable
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked
- When any test errors are found, resolve them until the entire test suite is green
- After moving files or changing imports, run tests to confirm everything still passes

## Self-Improvement
- After each interaction, reflect on any way to update this AGENTS.md file to improve future interactions
