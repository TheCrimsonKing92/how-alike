# Age Calibration Status - SUPERSEDED

**⚠️ NOTE (2025-01-20)**: This manual calibration approach is being replaced by a learned age-aware similarity calibrator. See `AGE_AWARE_SIMILARITY_PLAN.md` for the new direction.

## Summary

Age calibration was completed with 3-segment piecewise linear regression fitted on 143 UTKFace samples processed through the actual browser pipeline.

**Final Results**:
- **Overall MAE**: 14.6 years
- **Per-Age-Group MAE**:
  - Children (0-12): 14.6 years
  - Teens (13-19): 6.3 years
  - Young Adults (20-35): 8.7 years
  - Middle Age (36-59): 19.2 years
  - Seniors (60+): 33.8 years

**Calibration Method**: 3-segment piecewise linear regression
- Threshold 1: 30.6 (low → mid transition)
- Threshold 2: 49.7 (mid → high transition)
- Optimized via grid search over percentile positions

## What Was Completed

### 1. Tooling Created ✅

- **Web interface**: `web/src/app/calibrate/page.tsx` - Manual calibration UI
- **Batch automation**: `web/scripts/batch-calibrate.mjs` - Playwright-based batch data collection
- **Curve fitting**: `web/scripts/fit-calibration.mjs` - Multi-model regression (linear, polynomial, 2-segment, 3-segment)
- **Image selection**: `scripts/select-from-extracted.mjs`, `scripts/select-children.mjs` - Dataset sampling tools

### 2. Data Collection ✅

**Initial Dataset (22 samples)**:
- Validated browser pipeline approach
- Confirmed preprocessing match (face detection + IPD crop)
- Initial MAE: 11.73 years

**Extended Dataset (97 samples total)**:
- Added 77 diverse samples emphasizing young adults (20-40)
- MAE improved to 13.69 years for young adults (3.8 years)

**Child-Focused Expansion (143 samples total)**:
- Added 47 child samples (ages 1-12)
- Addressed high variance in very young children (0-2)
- Final dataset: 64 children, 79 adults

### 3. Model Selection ✅

Tested 4 regression methods:
1. **Linear**: MAE 15.51 years
2. **Polynomial (degree 2)**: MAE 15.27 years
3. **Piecewise-2 (1 threshold)**: MAE 14.77 years
4. **Piecewise-3 (2 thresholds)**: MAE 14.59 years ⭐ **SELECTED**

**Selection Rationale**:
- Best overall MAE (14.59 years)
- Better balance across age groups
- Children improved by 0.7 years vs 2-segment

### 4. Calibration Applied ✅

Updated `web/src/lib/age-estimation.ts` with final constants:

```typescript
const AGE_CALIBRATION = {
  threshold1: 30.6,
  threshold2: 49.7,
  lowSlope: 1.0902,
  lowIntercept: -8.90,
  midSlope: 0.0247,
  midIntercept: 15.55,
  highSlope: 0.8301,
  highIntercept: -11.39,
  minAge: 0,
  maxAge: 120,
};
```

### 5. Variance Analysis ✅

Analyzed raw prediction variance to distinguish model limitations from calibration issues:

**Findings**:
- Very young children (0-2): CV 34-40% (high model variance)
- Teens-Adults (13-40): CV 10-20% (moderate, improvable with calibration)
- Conclusion: Child predictions limited by model accuracy, not just calibration

---

## Identified Limitations

### 1. Model Accuracy Ceiling
- genderage.onnx has fundamental accuracy constraints
- MAE of 14.6 years cannot be significantly improved with calibration alone
- Model replacement would be needed for <5 year MAE target

### 2. Gender Misidentification
- Gender confusion correlates with age errors
- Adult male predicted as female with 16-year error (actual 25 → predicted 41)
- Suggests need for gender-specific calibration or better gender model

### 3. Variance for Young Children
- Ages 0-2 show coefficient of variation 34-40%
- Indicates model struggles with infant/toddler faces
- Calibration cannot fix high raw prediction variance

---

## Next Steps (See NEXT_IMPROVEMENTS.md)

### Immediate Options:

1. **Gender-Specific Calibration** (Low effort, moderate gain):
   - Fit separate curves for male vs female
   - Use existing 143-sample dataset with gender labels
   - Likely improves cases where gender affects age appearance

2. **Age Model Replacement** (High effort, high gain):
   - Research better pre-trained models (target: <5 year MAE)
   - Candidates: DEX, SSR-Net, newer InsightFace models
   - Would require re-integration and re-calibration

3. **Accept Current Accuracy** (Move on):
   - Document 14.6-year MAE as expected accuracy
   - Focus on relative age differences (which work reasonably)
   - Prioritize other improvements (pose normalization, occlusion handling)

**Recommendation**: Try gender-specific calibration first (low-hanging fruit), then evaluate if age model replacement is worth the effort.

## Validation

Browser testing with user's original images:
- **Child (~10 actual)**: Predicted ~16 (6-year error) ✅ Better than 14.6 MAE
- **Adult (~25 actual)**: Predicted ~41 (16-year error) ⚠️ Worse than 8.7 MAE, likely outlier due to gender confusion

**Conclusion**: Calibration is working as expected overall. Individual outliers exist due to model limitations.

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

Age calibration has achieved the best possible accuracy with the current genderage.onnx model. Further improvements require either:
1. Gender-specific calibration (incremental improvement)
2. Model replacement (significant improvement but high effort)

See **NEXT_IMPROVEMENTS.md** for detailed roadmap of all planned enhancements.
